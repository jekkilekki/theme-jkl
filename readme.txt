A simple, modern theme called JKL. Includes an optional centered logo with split navigation, custom page templates, and Post Formats. Template is fully responsive.

== Description ==

JKL is a simple, modern theme with great fonts (Volkhov and Source Sans Pro) developed by Aaron Snowberger specifically for http://justkeeplearning.xyz

== Features ==

= Post and Page Excerpts =

Pages also have the ability to have excerpts as Posts do by default. This is because they are styled as a featured lead-in section of text before the auto and publication metadata. Simply add an excerpt to a Post or Page and watch the magic happen.

= Customizer Options =

1. Custom colors
2. Custom logo and favicon
3. Header background color
4. Header text color
5. Optional Header image
6. Sidebar position: left, right, none (default) - this is also customizable on individual Pages

= Featured Images =

Featured Images default to take the place of the Header Image on any page as well as show up below the Post meta within the main content. In a later version, the Featured Image in this section may be able to be replaced with embedded media or turned off.

= Widget Areas =

1. Sidebar
2. Footer

= Blockquotes =

Blockquotes can be aligned left or right (in a similar way that images are) using the `"alignleft"` or `"alignright"` classes.

= Post Formats =

1. Aside - only styled with a date (no title)
2. Audio - highlights the featured audio above the Post content
3. Chat - each paragraph is presented as a dialogue bubble (use blockquote for plain text)
4. Gallery - highlights 3 layered gallery pictures and the count of number of pictures in the galleries
5. Image - highlights the Featured Image (or first image) prominently
6. Link - grabs a screenshot from the first link and features it prominently
7. Quote - oversized blockquote on a dark background (with Featured Image as background)
8. Status - styled to look slightly like a Twitter update
9. Video - highlights the featured video above the Post content

= Custom Page Templates =

1. Sidebar Left
2. Sidebar Right
3. No sidebar (narrow width)
4. No sidebar (full width)

== Development Roadmap ==

1. Add taxonomy dropdown capability for long lists of Categories or Tags
2. Add Customizer option to control this
3. Colorize (to identify) code headings created by Prism.js
